       MiniLibX  is  an  easy way to create graphical software, without any X-
       Window/Cocoa programming knowledge. It provides simple window creation,
       a drawing tool, image and basic events management.

       X-Window  is a network-oriented graphical system for Unix.  It is based
       on two main parts:
       On one side, your software wants to draw something on the screen and/or
       get keyboard & mouse entries.
       On  the other side, the X-Server manages the screen, keyboard and mouse
       (It is often refered to as a "display").
       A network connection must be established between these two entities  to
       send  drawing  orders  (from  the  software  to the X-Server), and key-
       board/mouse events (from the X-Server to the software).

       The MacOSX operating system handle graphical access to the  screen  (or
       "display").
       On one side, your software wants to draw something on the screen and/or
       get keyboard & mouse entries.
       On the other side, the underlying MacOSX graphical framework that  han-
       dles the screen, the windowing system, keyboard and mouse.
       A connection between these two entities must be established.

       mmllxx..hh  should  be  included  for a correct use of the MiniLibX API.  It
       only contains function prototypes, no structure is needed.

       First of all, you need to initialize the connection between your  soft-
       ware  and  the display.  Once this connection is established, you'll be
       able to use other MiniLibX functions to send the graphical orders, like
       "I  want  to draw a yellow pixel in this window" or "did the user hit a
       key?".

       The mmllxx__iinniitt function will create this connection.  No  parameters  are
       needed,  ant it will return a _v_o_i_d _* identifier, used for further calls
       to the library routines.

       All other MiniLibX functions are described in the following man pages:


       mmllxx__nneeww__wwiinnddooww      : manage windows

       mmllxx__ppiixxeell__ppuutt       : draw inside window

       mmllxx__nneeww__iimmaaggee       : manipulate images

       mmllxx__lloooopp            : handle keyboard or mouse events

       To use MiniLibX functions, you'll need to link your software with  sev-
       eral  libraries,  including  the  MiniLibX library itself.  To do this,
       simply add the following arguments at linking time:

       --llmmllxx --llXXeexxtt --llXX1111

       You may also need to specify the path to these libraries, using the  --LL
       flag.

       To  use  MiniLibX functions, you'll need to link your software with the
       MiniLibX library, and several system frameworks:

       --llmmllxx --ffrraammeewwoorrkk OOppeennGGLL --ffrraammeewwoorrkk AAppppKKiitt

       You may also need to specify the path to the  MiniLibX  library,  using
       the --LL flag.

       If  mmllxx__iinniitt(())  fails to set up the connection to the graphical system,
       it will return NULL, otherwise a non-null pointer is returned as a con-
       nection identifier.
